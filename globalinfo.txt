For the fisrt year the Institute for Astronomy was part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge!
NASA Space Apps Challenge is an international 48-hours coding marathon focused on space exploration that takes place in 140 cities around the world. The event embraces collaborative problem solving with a goal of producing relevant open-source solutions to address global needs applicable to both life on Earth and life in space.
NASA is leading this global collaboration along with a number of government collaborators and over 100 local organizing teams across the globe. However Hawaii was not part of that exciting project so the Institute of Astronomy decided to buid its own team and to meet the challenge.

Challenge summary:
Create data aggregators and visualizations of asteroid data in meaningful ways that can educate the public about the need to explore asteroids and protect the Earth from them. Extract data from existing asteroid databases and create clear, beautiful visualizations with them to show the power of asteroid exploration. You can develop code that establishes connections to asteroid data sources, create data visualizers that translate retrieved asteroid data into meaningful plots or presentations; and integrate the communications and data visualization code into an interactive educational website.

Here are some ways for you to frame this solution:
Web pages, communications, and data visualization source code including communications code that extracts data from asteroid databases;
web pages with information and embedded data visualizations;
be sure to use free languages and code libraries that do not require browser plug-ins; and provide source code with comments and associated documentation.
Project Documentation can describe the design process for the communications code, the design process for the data visualizations with screenshots and code snippets to illustrate the design processes.
Feel free to identify ideas for future work.

Project description: Hokulele Hula
Short overview: Like the Hula, a traditional hawaiian dance narrating the interaction between the native Hawaiians and the Sea, our project aims at providing new ways to tell the story between Asteroids ("Hokulele") and the Earth.  

Description:

Like the waves that come and go around an island, our planet Earth is surrounded by an ocean of asteroids moving around us. And like the sea, the asteroids can be both a threat or an opportunity for the planet and the humankind. 
For this project we aimed at developing original visualization tools that differ from the widely used and already well-known representation of the orbits of asteroids in our Solar system.
We then built simple and clear animation and graphic presentation of the relevant information on the potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) over the next hundred years. These objects come closer than 0.05 astronomical units (4647790 miles) and about 140 meters in size.

One originality about that project is also that the Space Apps Challenge overlapped with an Open House so we were able to explain our work to the general public and to gather their inputs.
We present at the end of that description a list of our contributors who provided very good advice.
 

### Data description ###
The data are the PHAs selected form the JPL ( http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risks/) and the MPC (http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/).  These objects come closer than 0.05 astronomical units (ua) and about 140 meters in size. We have extracted: the date, the probability of impact, the distance to the Earth and the Palermo scale that encodes the dangerosity of the asteroid and is related to the energy of the potential impact.
 

### 3D visualization of the Impact Globe ###
This project provide a 3D visualization of the probability of impact of asteroids over a window a 100 years. For each year, it shows the probability of impact of all PHAs around the Earth. The position are random however the length of the different lines encodes the probability of impact (the closer it gets to the Earth the more probable it will hit it) while the color encodes the energy of the impact (the redder the more dangerous).


## Wrapped time visualization of distance to the Earth ## 
This project is showing movies that represent the evolution of the PHAs distance to the Earth over the coming century. The movie is designed as a clock and people can follow how close the different objects will be from our planet Earth and select different level of potential hazard.
