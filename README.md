Visualization of the Asteroid Skies

## Project

H&#333;k&#363;lele Hula

H&#333;k&#363;lele means "shooting star" in Hawaiian.  Our goal is
to produce a visualization of the asteroid impact hazard, emphasizing
the long-term threat over the next 100 years.

## Description

JPL maintains a current list of the most hazardous asteroids at its
[Risk Page]:(http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risks/).  Instead of the
standard approach of visualizing the orbits of these asteroids using
a program such as [Celestia](ps1neos.png) we wanted to produce a
visualization of the immediate threat from all Risk Page asteroids
and show a snapshot of the 100-year risk outlook.

Our visualizations are the Impact Globe and the 100-Year Rose Plot.
The Impact Globe summarizes total impact threat over a window of
several years.  We tabulated the impact predictions from the JPL
risk page for all objects. Each "needle" on the Impact Globe
corresponds to a single asteroid's potential impact within a time
window.  A needle is given a color code according to the energy of
the potential impact (red is catastrophic, blue only a "light
scare"), and the length of the need indicates the likelihood of an
impact.

The Rose Plot shows the distance of a hazardous asteroid from Earth
over the next 100 years, showing the periodic close approaches and
potential impacts.  For all the Risk Page objects, we obtained
orbital elements from the <a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net">IAU
Minor Planet Center</a> and computed positions for all the asteroids
every day for 100 years into the future.  The Rose Plot shows the
distance from Earth for each asteroid for the next 100 years.
