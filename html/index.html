H&#333;k&#363;lele means "shooting star" in Hawaiian.

Like the Hula, a traditional Hawaiian dance narrating the interaction
between the native Hawaiians and the Sea, our project aims at
providing new ways to tell the story between asteroids (H&#333;k&#363;lele)
and the Earth.

<p>
JPL maintains a current list of the most hazardous asteroids at its
<a target="_blank" href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risks/">Risk
Page</a>. Instead of the standard approach of visualizing the orbits
of these asteroids using a program such as <a target="_blank"
href="ps1neos.png">Celestia</a> we wanted to try to visualize both
the immediate threat from all Risk Page asteroids and to show a
snapshot of the 100-year risk outlook.

<p>
Our visualizations are the <a href="globe.html">Impact Globe</a> and the <a href="rose.html">100-Year Rose Plot</a>.
The Impact Globe summarizes total impact threat over a window of
several years. We tabulated the impact predictions from the JPL
risk page for all objects. Each "needle" on the Impact Globe
corresponds to a single asteroid's potential impact within a time
window. A needle is given a color code according to the energy of
the potential impact (red is catastrophic, blue only a "light
scare"), and the length of the need indicates the likelihood of an
impact.

<p>
The Rose Plot shows the distance of a hazardous asteroid from Earth
over the next 100 years, showing the periodic close approaches and
potential impacts. For all the Risk Page objects, we obtained orbital
elements from the IAU Minor Planet Center and computed positions
for all the asteroids every day for 100 years into the future. The
Rose Plot shows the distance from Earth for each asteroid over the
next 100 years. The dashed lines show the Earth-Moon distance and
Geosync satellite altitude. Asteroids whose rose plot extends inside
these dashed circles have approaches closer than the moon and
geosynchronous satellite altitude, respectively.

<p>
The 2015 SpaceApps Challenge coincided with the University of
Hawaii's 2015 Open House, so we were able to solicit the input of
dozens of attendees who stopped by the 2015 SpaceApps Challenge
room at the Open House.
